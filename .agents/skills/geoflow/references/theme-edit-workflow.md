# Theme Edit Workflow

Use this workflow when the request is to adjust a theme that already exists in a GEOFlow workspace.

## System Signals To Detect

The current GEOFlow theme system is considered present when the workspace contains:

- `artisan`
- `routes/web.php`
- `resources/views/site`
- `resources/views/theme/<theme-id>/...`
- `app/Support/Site/SiteThemeViewResolver.php`
- `app/Support/Site/HomepageModuleBuilder.php` when the homepage builder exists
- `resources/views/site/partials/homepage-modules.blade.php` when homepage builder rendering exists
- theme selection in `resources/views/admin/site-settings/index.blade.php`
- homepage module save/preset/import routes in `routes/web.php` when the builder UI exists
- `site_settings.active_theme` storing the active theme ID
- `site_settings.homepage_modules` and `site_settings.homepage_style` storing homepage builder content when present

Legacy PHP workspaces may still use `/themes`, `includes/theme_preview.php`, and `theme-preview.php`; treat those as fallback only.

## Workflow States

### 1. Discover

- inspect `resources/views/theme` first, then legacy `/themes` only when Laravel signals are absent
- read each `manifest.json`
- collect editable files:
  - `home.blade.php`
  - `category.blade.php`
  - `article.blade.php`
  - `about.blade.php`
  - `layout.blade.php`
  - `partials/*.blade.php`
  - `assets/theme.css`
  - `public/themes/<theme-id>/theme.css`
  - `public/themes/<theme-id>/theme.js` when already present
  - optional `tokens.json`
  - optional `mapping.json`
- note which themes already look like preview or edit-session forks
- detect whether the current system supports homepage builder JSON import and list supported module types, style tokens, presets, and import modes

Recommended helper:
- `scripts/discover_themes.py`

### 2. Select

- resolve `target_theme_id`
- if the user did not specify a theme, prefer the active theme when known
- if the active theme is unknown, present the discovered themes and ask the model to keep the selection explicit in its plan

### 3. Fork Preview Session

- do not edit the target theme live on the first pass
- create a preview fork under `resources/views/theme/<preview-theme-id>` for Laravel GEOFlow
- copy `public/themes/<base-theme-id>` to `public/themes/<preview-theme-id>` when runtime assets exist
- mark the fork clearly as preview or edit-session in `manifest.json`
- emit public route samples and clearly note whether the current app has isolated preview routes

Recommended helper:
- `scripts/prepare_theme_edit_session.py`

### 4. AI Edit Loop

Safe edit surface:

- Blade files inside the selected theme
- `assets/theme.css`
- `public/themes/<theme-id>/theme.css` and optional `theme.js` when the theme layout loads public runtime assets
- `manifest.json`
- optional tokens and mapping files

Fixed contracts during the edit loop:

- do not hard-code `/geo_admin`
- preserve SEO, canonical, and schema output
- preserve article rendered-HTML behavior and style tables/headings/lists/code blocks through CSS
- do not show filename-only image captions
- keep preview/activation separate
- preserve rich homepage modules only on the default homepage unless search/category states are intentionally redesigned

Typical requests:

- make the layout wider
- make titles bolder
- reduce card noise
- simplify metadata
- add a display module only when it can be built from existing GEOFlow data
- enrich the default homepage with hero/media, charts, metrics, text modules, service/category blocks, case/resource blocks, large visuals, or CTA bands while keeping search/category states clean

Homepage builder path:

- when `HomepageModuleBuilder` is available, create `homepage-design.json` for module/style changes that fit the builder
- include `replace` or `append` import mode guidance
- use builder-supported types before inventing Blade-only modules for the same section
- keep `custom_html` small, sanitized, and free of scripts/forms/iframes
- do not post the import route until the operator accepts the exact payload

### 5. Review Preview

- inspect preview URLs for home, category, article, and About
- call out what changed, what remained fixed, and where risks still exist
- verify default homepage richness separately from search and category result states
- review `homepage-design.json` separately when the builder path is used, including style tokens, module order, links, article sources, and import mode
- keep iterating on the preview fork until the operator confirms

### 6. Finalize

After preview approval, choose one path:

- `publish_as_new_theme`
  - keep the preview fork as a new theme or rename it to a stable theme id
  - the admin theme picker can then discover it as a new template
- `replace_base_theme`
  - for Laravel, back up under `storage/app/private/geoflow-theme-backups`
  - for legacy PHP, pass `--backup-root` as a persistent parent outside the web workspace; the helper creates a dedicated mode-`0700` child and rejects temporary locations
  - replace the target theme from the confirmed preview fork
  - warn that the live site may change immediately if that target theme is active
- `activate_after_confirmation`
  - activation should happen only after review
  - prefer the admin site-settings flow unless the user explicitly wants direct system mutation
- `import_homepage_design_after_confirmation`
  - applies only when homepage builder import exists
  - import the reviewed `homepage-design.json` through the admin flow or route
  - warn that imported homepage modules can affect the live default homepage immediately

Recommended helper:
- `scripts/finalize_theme_edit_session.py`

## Safety Rules

- preview first, live later
- keep backups outside theme discovery and web-served roots
- finalize only while the base theme, preview theme, and matching public assets are under one exclusive edit session; pause concurrent editors, deployers, and finalizers
- the finalize helper uses an exclusive workspace lock and fails closed when another finalizer may still be running; inspect a stale lock before removing it
- require valid object-shaped `manifest.json` and consistent `edit-session.json` IDs before a live replacement
- reject symbolic links, named pipes, sockets, devices, and other non-regular entries in copied theme trees
- stage the view and public-asset trees before the first live rename; on commit failure, restore every live tree and report any cleanup path that remains
- do not add modules that require backend fields GEOFlow does not already expose
- do not invent corporate claims, logos, forms, testimonials, or chart data that the current view cannot support
- do not treat homepage builder import as a preview route; it is a settings change unless the operator has a separate staging workflow
- do not touch routing, search, SEO generation, or schema generation unless the user explicitly expands scope

## Topic edit coverage

Follow [topic-workflow.md](topic-workflow.md) when topics are in scope. Discover nested `topics/*.blade.php`, `topics/templates/*.blade.php`, the manifest topic declaration, `public/themes/{theme_id}/topics.css` and `topics.js` (or matching package assets). Preserve these through preview forks and finalization. Include topic list/detail, search/tag/pagination, empty states, homepage and article backlinks in review. Signed remote workspace previews provide the actual links; source helper route samples need real content and do not prove isolated preview availability.

## Theme library management

Use the website settings theme section (`#site-settings-theme`) for the local template library. Resolve the configured admin base path before constructing a URL.

- The current theme stays pinned above all filters. Featured shows six curated choices: core default, enterprise signature, section blue, ink editorial, knowledge paper, and research journal.
- My themes contains installed, private, and unknown custom themes. Archive contains other builtin samples and explicitly archived entries. Search accepts a name, use case, or exact theme ID; pagination retains filters. Customer version groups show the active version first, otherwise the latest, with older versions available in the expanded group.
- Archive and restore use the authenticated UI batch workflow. Archive is reversible and preserves code, installation receipts, IDs, and existing bindings. The active theme and the core default cannot be archived. Do not delete theme directories to reproduce this operation.
- `SiteThemeCatalog::all()` and source discovery remain complete runtime catalogs. Library visibility comes from `config/theme-library.php` and `site_settings.theme_library_state`; source discovery can find archived themes. Library state changes do not change the immutable appearance binding or publish content.
- Generic administrator previews use `site-settings/themes/{theme_id}/preview/{page}` under the configured admin path. `__system_default` selects the core default; `active_theme=''` is the explicit core selection. Keep missing settings distinct from an explicit empty selection.
- Preview home, category, article, topic list, topic detail, and topic empty states with real published content. A selected active theme keeps its published immutable revision. Previewing another theme isolates that revision and its finder; preview does not activate a theme, count a read, or submit forms.
- Enable from the selected card after reviewing its inline confirmation. Use the current appearance revision to reject stale writes; reread the pinned theme after success. Export operates on the selected card's ID. Template import, replication, homepage composition, and release continue through their existing workflows.
- Remote CLI archival support must be discovered from the installed client's help and the target instance's capabilities. These local UI routes do not establish a remote CLI command or management API for archival.
