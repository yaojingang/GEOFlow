## 🧱 System Architecture

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Web / Admin | Front-end article site and admin dashboard — handles content browsing, material management, task management, and configuration |
| API / CLI | `/api/v1` provides machine-readable interfaces; `bin/geoflow` provides local CLI capabilities for batch tasks and automation |
| Scheduler / Worker | Scheduler scans tasks and enqueues them; Worker handles actual model calls to generate content |
| Domain Services | Task, article, queue, AI, and retrieval services in `includes/` implement core business rules |
| Persistence | PostgreSQL serves as the runtime database, storing tasks, articles, materials, review states, and system configuration |

Core Pipeline:

1. Configure models, prompts, and material libraries in the admin panel
2. Create a task and enter scheduling
3. Scheduler writes to the job queue
4. Worker calls AI to generate content
5. Articles enter the Draft → Review → Publish pipeline
6. Front-end renders articles and SEO pages

## 🎯 Use Cases and Expected Outcomes

GEOFlow fits these practical scenarios:

- **Independent GEO website**  
  Run a standalone site for product explainers, FAQs, cases, and brand knowledge. The goal is to improve AI-search visibility, citation coverage, and operating efficiency, not to mass-produce low-value pages.
- **GEO sub-channel inside an official website**  
  Add a dedicated editorial or knowledge channel under an existing corporate site. The goal is to make brand content more structured, more searchable, and easier for teams to maintain.
- **Independent GEO source site**  
  Build a site around a specific industry, topic, or question set, and keep publishing high-quality explainers, lists, guides, and analysis. The goal is to build credible content assets, not to pollute the web.
- **Internal GEO content management system**  
  Use GEOFlow mainly as an internal backend for models, assets, knowledge bases, prompts, review, and publishing workflows. The goal is higher team efficiency and less fragmented tooling.
- **Multi-site / multi-channel GEO deployment**  
  Operate multiple sites, sections, or themes from one system pattern. The goal is standardized content operations, theme switching, and distribution management.
- **Automated source management and content distribution**  
  Treat GEOFlow as an operating layer for knowledge assets, editorial updates, and controlled distribution. The goal is to help useful information stay structured, trustworthy, and reusable.

The benefits of this system should come from a **real, well-maintained, high-quality knowledge base**.  
It is not meant for fabricating content, flooding the internet, or gaming search systems with false information. GEOFlow is designed to improve AI marketing efficiency and GEO operating efficiency by making trusted content easier to manage and distribute.

## 🧭 Suggested Deployment and Usage Patterns

Recommended ways to use GEOFlow by scenario:

- **As a standalone GEO website**  
  Deploy the full frontend and admin stack and run it as an independent content property for product, FAQ, solution, and case content.
- **As a GEO sub-channel of an existing website**  
  Launch GEOFlow as a dedicated subdirectory, subdomain, or side channel without rebuilding the main site.
- **As a GEO source site**  
  Focus on one topic or vertical, prioritize knowledge-base construction, and use tasks for controlled updates over time.
- **As an internal GEO content backend**  
  Use the admin, models, assets, prompts, queue, API, CLI, and Skill integration primarily as an internal content operations system.
- **As a multi-site or multi-channel system**  
  Operate multiple brands, themes, sections, or experiments with shared workflows and repeatable deployment patterns.
- **As an automated source-management system**  
  Treat title libraries, image libraries, prompt libraries, and knowledge bases as long-term infrastructure rather than disposable generation inputs.

Suggested order of work:

1. Start from a real business goal and real audience
2. Build the knowledge base before building automation
3. Make sure content is accurate, reviewable, and maintainable
4. Then use models, tasks, and themes to improve efficiency

If the knowledge base is weak, automation will only scale noise. In GEOFlow, **knowledge-base quality should come first**.

## ⚙️ Environment Variable Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed:

```dotenv
# Web service exposed port (default: 18080)
HOST_PORT=18080

# Site access URL (must match HOST_PORT)
SITE_URL=http://localhost:18080

# Application secret key (use a random string of 32+ characters)
APP_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret

# Cron scheduling interval (seconds, default: 60)
CRON_INTERVAL=60

# Timezone
TZ=Asia/Shanghai
```

## 📖 Getting Started Workflow

1. Log into the admin panel  
Visit `/geo_admin/` and sign in with the admin account. Default credentials: `admin / admin888`. You can change these after logging in.

2. Configure AI Models  
Go to "AI Configuration Center → AI Model Management" to add models — fill in the API URL, model ID, and API key. Use the **Quick Provider Fill** buttons to pre-fill settings for popular providers:

   | Provider | API Base URL | Model ID |
   |----------|-------------|---------|
   | **MiniMax** | `https://api.minimax.io` | `MiniMax-M2.7` / `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed` |
   | OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com` | `gpt-4o` |
   | DeepSeek | `https://api.deepseek.com` | `deepseek-chat` |
   | Zhipu GLM | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` | `glm-4.6` / `glm-5` |
   | Volcengine Ark | `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3` | inference endpoint ID such as `ep-xxxx` |

   You can enter either a provider base URL or a full endpoint URL. Chat models default to `/v1/chat/completions`, while embedding models default to `/v1/embeddings`. GEOFlow also auto-detects Zhipu `/api/paas/v4` and Volcengine Ark `/api/v3` style bases and expands them to the correct capability-specific path. Dedicated rerank model wiring is not available yet.

3. Prepare Materials  
Create title libraries, image libraries, knowledge bases, and prompt templates.

4. Create a Task  
In "Task Management", select a title library, model, prompt, image library, and publishing rules.

5. Start Generation  
The task enters the scheduling and worker execution pipeline. Articles are generated to draft or published directly based on configuration.

> After initial deployment, it is strongly recommended to change the admin password and `APP_SECRET_KEY` immediately.

Directory Conventions:

- Front-end entry files stay in the root for easy deployment and route mapping
- `admin/` holds admin pages and admin action entry points
- `api/v1/` holds the official external API
- `bin/` holds CLI, scheduling, and maintenance scripts
- `includes/` holds core business logic and the service layer
- `docs/` only retains externally useful documentation

## 🛡 Security Notes

- All database operations use **PDO prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection
- All form submissions verify **CSRF Tokens**
- Output content is escaped with **HTMLSpecialChars** to prevent XSS
- Admin passwords are stored using **bcrypt** encryption
- Configurable security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

> ⚠️ Before production deployment, make sure to change the `APP_SECRET_KEY` in `.env` and update the default admin password.
>
> To report security issues, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
